Project MHA is my first completed Java project, a Minecraft server mini game plugin that allows players to play with their friends by hosting this plugin onto your server! This project was made in 2021 during COVID, originally created to play with my friends during COVID-19.

I have decided to make this public so that future developers can understand and get a better understanding of how most systems were created in vanilla Minecraft.
  - The code isn't necessarily the best nor is it efficient :P

Gameplay of this plugin can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/omcMQhTf1b0)

This is the entire project file - You must compile and build the project if you would like to use it for server production.

## Warning
This project is not necessarily player friendly.
